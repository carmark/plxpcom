This is the quick-n-dirty instructions for getting up and running with 
Perl XPCOM in mozilla on Unix. For detailed instructions, see the README file
in this directory.

Untar the perl XPCOM package into mozilla's extensions directory.

Add the following Makefiles into allmakefiles.sh in the top mozilla dir:
(Hint: Search for the name of another extensions directory and you'll find 
where you need to add these.)

        # This section of code is already in allmakefiles.sh. I put it
        # here to give you a reference for navigating this file.
        p3p ) MAKEFILES_extensions="$MAKEFILES_extensions
            extensions/p3p/Makefile
            extensions/p3p/public/Makefile
            extensions/p3p/resources/Makefile
            extensions/p3p/resources/content/Makefile
            extensions/p3p/resources/locale/Makefile
            extensions/p3p/resources/locale/en-US/Makefile
            extensions/p3p/resources/skin/Makefile
            extensions/p3p/src/Makefile
            " ;;
        # This is the part you need to add. Cut and paste this into
        # allmakefiles.sh
        perl ) MAKEFILES_extensions="$MAKEFILES_extensions
            extensions/perl/Makefile
            extensions/perl/XPCOM/Makefile
            extensions/perl/src/Makefile
            extensions/perl/tests/Makefile
            extensions/perl/public/Makefile
            " ;;
        # Done

Add the following line to the .mozconfig file in the top mozilla dir:
  ac_add_options --enable-extensions=default,perl

You may also want to add --disable-pedantic, if it does not compile.

Build mozilla depending of your installation (you have to use GNU make):

  make -f client.mk build

or

  ./configure && make

When done building go into the extensions/perl/XPCOM directory and as root 
run:

  make module_install

This installs the perl module parts of the package into your perl installation.

You should now have a perl enabled mozilla. If you made a debug build you 
should also have an nsTestPerlSample test in the dist/bin directory of your 
tree.
